# CONTRIBUTIONS (Workflow) DOCUMENT

"have a contributions document that outlines how the team will work together (expected workflow practices)"

Each team member will work in their own branch. Team-members won't directly commit to the master branch without approval from the rest of the team. (It'll probably happen at least once by accident...but we're going to try very hard!!!). Merging with master can be done locally in git and pushed or through a pull request on github - depending on personal preference. In the event a teammember has unresolvable issues with git, slack is the backup option for sharing work with a second teammember who will put the work into the repository. When it makes sense, requests for small change in code actively being worked on by another teammember should just be made via slack instead of risking creating merge headaches by making different changes to the same portion of code in different branches.
